=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a framework for setting up and tearing down temporary
databases for testing purposes. This framework requires a user (optionally with
password) which has the ability to create new databases and works by creating
test-specific databases owned by the user specified using the naming
convention: C<(testing_db_{time}_{proc}_{rand})>.

=head1 METHODS

This package implements the following methods:

=cut

=head2 create

  create(Str :$database, Str %options) : Maybe[InstanceOf["Test::DB::Object"]]

The create method generates a database based on the type specified and returns
a C<Test::DB::Object> with an active connection, C<dbh> and C<dsn>. If the
database specified doesn't have a corresponding database drive this method will
returned the undefined value. The type of database can be omitted if the
C<TESTDB_DATABASE> environment variable is set, if not the type of database
must be either C<sqlite>, C<mysql>, or C<postgres>. Any options provided are
passed along to the test database object class constructor.
